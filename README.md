**Title:** Top 5 league clubs cost of operations Dashboard

**Tools Used:** Excel (power query, xlookup function, unique function, filter function ) and power bi (Measures,slicers, table, pie chart,line chart, power query)

**Project Description:** This project aim is to analyze the cost of success of clubs who remained in the top flight league of the 5 major football leagues in Europe for 10 years spanning from 2015/2016 season till 2024/2025 season. The cost consists of the wage bill and transfer fees spent across those seasons of each club with the aim of finding the cost per point earned.
